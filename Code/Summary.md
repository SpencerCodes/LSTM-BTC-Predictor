In this project we compared the effectivness of a LSTM RNN using two different datasets, to predict historic Bitcoin closing prices. 

My results showed that historic bitcoin closing prices are a better predictor of future closing prices when used in this model compared to FNG scores. Although both could be used together to a greater effect.
